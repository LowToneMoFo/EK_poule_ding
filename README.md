I hacked together a simple python script to generate football scores to use in a betting competition for the European Championships in my workplace.
It uses a weighted table of the 15 most common soccer scores according to https://footystats.org/stats/common-score

I used it to generate results to score the entire tournament beforehand, intending not to look at it again until the tourney finishes to see how my statistsics fare against collegues who actually know anything about football.
